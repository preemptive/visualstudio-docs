# Install Dotfuscator Community

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

Dotfuscator Community has been included, free of charge, with Visual Studio since Visual Studio .NET 2003.
This page details how to obtain Dotfuscator Community 6, so that you can begin protecting your application.

If you were previously using Dotfuscator Community 5, please see [Upgrading from Community 5][upgrade] instead of these instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the versions of Dotfuscator Community shipped with releases of Visual Studio,
> PreEmptive Solutions also periodically provides updated versions on its website.
> If you want to download the **latest version** directly instead of installing from Visual Studio,
> **[click here to go to the Dotfuscator Downloads page][download]**.

## Within Visual Studio

You can install Dotfuscator Community from the Visual Studio IDE:

1. Ensure that Visual Studio is up-to-date.
   For details, see [Update Visual Studio][vs-update].

2. In Visual Studio's **Search Box** (Ctrl+Q), type `dotfuscator`.

3. In the search results shown, under the *Components* heading, select **Install PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator**.

   * If you instead see, under the *Menus* heading, **PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator Community**, then Dotfuscator Community is already installed. Select that option to [get started][get-started].

4. A Visual Studio Installer window will launch, pre-configured to install Dotfuscator Community.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may be required to provide administrator credentials to continue.

5. In the Visual Studio Installer window, click *Install*.

Once the installation is complete, you can [start using Dotfuscator Community][get-started].

## During Visual Studio Installation

If you have not yet installed Visual Studio, you can obtain the installer from [the Visual Studio website][vs-install].
When run, it will display installation options for the selected Visual Studio edition:

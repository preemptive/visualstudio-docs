# Upgrade to Dotfuscator Professional

While Dotfuscator Community provides a basic level of protection, upgrading to ***PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator* Professional** will give you access to enhanced obfuscation transforms and protection capabilities.
These include:

* *Intellectual Property Protection*
  * Additional renaming options, including Enhanced Overload Induction™ and randomized identifier selection.
  * Access to enterprise-level obfuscation transforms, including [transforms targeted at defeating automated code decompilation][control-flow].
  * The ability to [obscure sensitive strings][string-encryption], making a simple search of the decompiled code impossible.
  * The ability to [discreetly embed ownership and distribution strings into your assemblies][watermarking] (software watermarking), allowing you to determine the source of unauthorized software leaks.
  * The ability to [combine multiple assemblies into one][linking], making it even more difficult for attackers to determine the roles of code elements, as separation of concerns has been eliminated.
  * The ability to [automatically remove unused code from your application][pruning], reducing the amount of sensitive code that is shipped.
* *Application Integrity Protection*
  * Additional [application defense behaviors][check-actions].
  * The ability to inject anti-tamper and anti-debug code into `.dll` assemblies.
  * The ability to provide a warning period before an application's end-of-life deadline.
  * The ability to notify application code during an end-of-life warning period or after the deadline.

Dotfuscator Professional is the industry standard [.NET Obfuscator][net-obfuscator] and is suitable for enterprise developers requiring ongoing support, maintenance, and product updates.
Additionally, Dotfuscator Professional offers tighter integration with Visual Studio and is licensed for commercial use.
